We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of building and training a Traffic Sign Classification network with Keras.


## Instructions

1. Set up your development environment with the [CarND Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)
2. Launch the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook


Since this is a self-assesd lab, you can view the solution by running the `traffic-sign-classification-with-keras-solution.ipynb` notebook. Make sure you're only running one notebook at a time.

## Help
Remember that you can get assistance from your mentor, Forums (click the link on the left side of the classroom), or the [Slack channel](https://carnd.slack.com). You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons, or consult external documentation.
